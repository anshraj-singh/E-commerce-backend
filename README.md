# Authentication and Authorization with Spring Security

This project implements user authentication and authorization using Spring Security. The following features are included:

1. **User  Registration**: Users can create accounts via the `/user/createUser ` endpoint, which is publicly accessible.

2. **User  Authentication**: Basic authentication is enabled, allowing users to log in and access their information.

3. **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Admins can access endpoints under `/admin/**` (e.g., retrieving and deleting users).
    - Users can access their own information via `/user/me` and update their details at `/user/update-user`.

4. **Password Security**: User passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt before being stored in the database.

5. **Stateless Session Management**: The application is configured to use stateless session management, enhancing security.

### Configuration

- **Spring Security Configuration**: The `SpringSecurityConfig` class configures HTTP security, user authentication, and password encoding.
- **Custom User Details Service**: The `CustomeUser DetailsService` retrieves user details for authentication.

### Usage

To test the authentication and authorization features, use tools like Postman to send requests to the specified endpoints, ensuring to include authentication headers where required.

This setup provides a robust foundation for managing user access and securing your application.


## Recent Updates

### Security Enhancements

1. **User  ID Handling**:
    - Removed the need to pass user IDs as path variables in the `CartController` and `OrderController`.
    - Instead, the authenticated user's ID is now retrieved from the security context, ensuring that users can only access their own cart and orders.

2. **Controller Updates**:
    - Modified methods in the `CartController` and `OrderController` to utilize the authenticated user's ID.
    - This change enhances security by preventing unauthorized access to other users' carts and orders.

3. **Security Context Usage**:
    - Implemented the use of the security context to fetch the current user's information in methods that require access to the user's cart or orders.
    - This ensures that all operations are performed in the context of the authenticated user.
